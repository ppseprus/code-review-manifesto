# The Code Review Manifesto

1. **I do not write perfect code. Nobody does.** _This is rather obvious..._
2. **I always want to improve myself. Everybody should.** _Nothing to explain here. Keep reading!_
3. **I believe that _Code Review_ is a useful tool to write quality code.** _It's a belief - Can't argue with that!_
4. **I ask for _Code Review_ to better myself as well as to improve the quality of the work I do.**
5. **An _issue_ is something that A) goes against the conventions, B) breaks the code, C) is simply missing or D) is dead wrong!**
6. **A _suggestion_ is something that is not an issue but could improve the code in some ways.**
7. **I do not take comments personally. Not even a bit. Ever.** _It's work and I'm a professional!_
8. **I do not write pejorative comments. Ever.** _Again, I'm a professional!_
9. **I try to be constructive with my comments.** _The only way to go._
10. **I comment on each and every occurrence of an issue.** _This makes it easier for the developer to know all the lines that are needed to be edited._
11. **If I don't understand something, I ask about it.** _No shame in that!_
12. **I always add a summary of the verbal discussions.** _It is a quick and efficient way to overcome issues, but others might have the same issue._
13. **I always reply to each and every comment, in a meaningful way.** _You never know who reads a thread and when, and who might learn from it now or then._
14. **When in doubt, write something fun!** _Having fun is a good way to avoid frustration..._
